###1 [Dryad: Distributed Data-Parallel Programs from Sequential Building Blocks][1]

####1.1 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
* A job is a directed acyclic graph where each vertex is a program and edges represent data channels.
* The Dryad system does not include any native data model for serialization and the concrete type of an item is left entirely up to applications, which can supply their own serialization and deserialization routines.

####1.2 DESCRIBING A DRYAD GRAPH
* `\(G = ⟨V_G, E_G, I_G, O_G⟩\)`,G contains a sequence of vertices `\(V_G\)`, a set of directed edges `\(E_G\)`,and two sets `\(I_G ⊆ V_G\)`and `\(O_G ⊆ V_G\)` that “tag” some of the vertices as being inputs and outputs respectively.
* Creating new vertices
    * A singleton graph is generated from a vertex v as G = ⟨(v), ∅, {v}, {v}⟩.
    * A graph can be cloned into a new graph containing k copies of its structure using the ^ operator where C = G^k is defined as:`\(C = ⟨V_G^1 ⊕···⊕V_G^k, E_G^1 ∪···∪ E_G^k, I_G^1 ∪···∪ I_G^k, O_G^1 ∪···∪ O_G^k⟩\)`.Here `\(G^n =⟨V_G^n, E_G^n, I_G^n, O_G^n⟩\)`is a “clone” of G containing copies of all of G’s vertices and edges, ⊕ denotes sequence concatenation.
* Adding graph edges
    * C = A ◦ B creates a new graph:`\(C =⟨VA ⊕ VB, E_A ∪ E_B ∪ E_{new}, I_A, O_B⟩\)`. C contains the union of all the vertices and edges in A and B, with A’s inputs and B’s outputs. Directed edges `\(E_{new}\)` are introduced between vertices in `\(O_A\)` and `\(I_B\)`. `\(V_A\)` and `\(V_B\)` are enforced to be `disjoint` at run time, and since A and B are both acyclic, C is also.
    * We define two standard compositions:
        * A >= B forms a pointwise composition as shown in Figure 3(c).
        * A >> B forms the complete bipartite graph between `\(O_A\)` and `\(I_B\)` and is shown in Figure 3(d).
* Merging two graphs
    * C = A || B creates a new graph:`\(C = ⟨V_A ⊕^∗ V_B, E_A ∪ E_B, I_A ∪^∗ I_B, O_A ∪^∗ O_B⟩\)`

* Job inputs and outputs
    * Large input files are typically partitioned and distributed across the computers of the cluster.
    * Similarly on job completion a set of output partitions can be logically concatenated to form a single named distributed file.
* Job Stages
    * The stage topology can be seen as a “skeleton” or summary of the overall job.
    * Each distinct type of vertex is grouped into a separate stage.

####1.3 WRITING A VERTEX PROGRAM
* The primary APIs for writing a Dryad vertex program are exposed through C++ base classes and objects.
* We provide a library “process wrapper” vertex that forks an executable supplied as an invocation parameter.It is easy, for example, to invoke perl scripts or grep at some vertices of a Dryad job.
* Most Dryad vertices contain purely sequential code. We also support an event-based programming style.In some cases it may be worth investing this effort, and many of the standard Dryad vertex classes, including non-deterministic merge, sort, and generic maps and joins, are built using the event-based programming style.

####1.4 JOB EXECUTION
* The scheduler inside the job manager keeps track of the state and history of each vertex in the graph.Each execution of the vertex has a version number and a corresponding “execution record” that contains the state of that execution and the versions of the predecessor vertices from which its inputs are derived. Each execution names its file-based output channels uniquely using its version number to avoid conflicts among versions
* When all of a vertex’s input channels become ready a new execution record is created for the vertex and placed in a scheduling queue.
* A vertex and any of its channels may each specify a “hard- constraint” or a “preference” listing the set of computers on which it would like to run.
* Files representing temporary channels are stored in directories managed by the daemon and cleaned up after the job completes, and vertices are killed by the daemon if their “parent” job manager crashes.

1. Fault tolerance policy
    * Our default failure policy is suitable for the common case that all vertex programs are deterministic.
    * Each vertex belongs to a “stage,” and each stage has a manager object that receives a callback on every state transition of a vertex execution in that stage, and on a regular timer interrupt. Within this callback the stage manager holds a global lock on the job manager data-structures and can therefore implement quite sophisticated behaviors.
2. Run-time graph refinement![dryad4](/assets/2013-09-20-dryad/dryad4.png)
