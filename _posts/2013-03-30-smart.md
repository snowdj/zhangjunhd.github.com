制定目标看似一件简单的事情，每个人都有过制定目标的经历，但是如果上升到技术的层面，可借鉴SMART原则(目标管理由管理学大师[Peter Drucker][1]提出，首先出现于他的著作《管理实践》（The Practice of Management）一书中)。

<!--break-->

　　1. 目标必须是具体的（Specific）

　　2. 目标必须是可以衡量的（Measurable）

　　3. 目标必须是可以达到的（Achievable）

　　4. 目标必须和其他目标具有相关性（Relevant）

　　5. 目标必须具有明确的截止期限（Time-based）
　　

具体点儿的说明参考[《Pragmatic Thinking and Learning》][2]

    6.2 Target SMART Objectives

    a.Specific  
    First, an objective should be specific. That is, it’s not enough to say “I want to     learn Erlang.” Narrow that down to something concrete, such as “I want to be able to write a web server in Erlang that dynamically generates content.”

    b.Measurable  
    How do you know when you’re done? That has always been one of my favorite consulting 
    questions. To have any chance of meeting an objective, you have to be able to 
    measure it somehow. Measurable goes hand-in-hand with being specific. It’s hard to 
    measure something general and abstract but much easier to measure something concrete
    and specific—using actual numbers. If you think you can’t measure your objective, 
    then it’s probably not specific enough.

    But be sure to take small bites and measure steady, incremental progress. You can’t 
    expect to lose fifty pounds in a week or learn a whole new programming language and 
    all its libraries in a week- end. Measure your objectives, but stage them in 
    increments.

    You don’t have to see where you’re going; you don’t have to see your destination or 
    everything you will pass along the away. You just have to see two or three feet 
    ahead of you.

    c.Achievable  
    A goal or objective that you cannot attain is not a target; it’s just a maddening, 
    soul-sucking frustration.Make each next objective attainable from where you are now.

    d.Relevant  
    Does this really matter to you—is it important to you, and are you passionate about 
    it? Is it something that’s even under your control? If not, then it isn’t relevant.

    It needs to matter and be something that you have control over.

    e.Time-Boxed  
    This is perhaps the most important one. It means you need to give yourself a 
    deadline. Without deadlines, a goal will languish and be perpetually pushed aside by
     the more pressing exigencies of the day. It will never happen.

    Again, take small bites. Give yourself frequent, small milestones. You’ll be more 
    motivated when you meet them and encouraged to rise to meet the next one.

一个目标可以对应开展一个主题研究，同一时间段展开的主题不宜太多，以免拉长战线，使自己失去信心和耐心，也无法高效实现Time-Boxed。对应每一个主题研究可以使用如下模板，以便于很好的贯彻SMART原则。

    1 Specific
    (达到什么样的Goal，应该是具体的和操作的,可以基于其构建相应的反馈机制？)

    Goal

    2 Measurable
    (如何衡量你是否达到你的Goal和Objective？在整个过程中，会产出4样东西：1.Solved Questions应该记
    录到记忆卡中不断消化；2.Unsolved Questions应该保留为以后立项的依据；Post Articles：总结的文章
    (练习写作)；Post PPTs：总结的PPT(以教代学))

    Solved Questions

    Unsolved Questions

    Posted Articles

    Post PPTs

    3 Achievable
    (针对你的Goal，你应该切分如下的子Objective，帮助最终实现你的Goal)

    Objective


    4 Relevant
    (为什么要立项？你的Context是什么)


    5 Time-boxed
    (列出所有计划的milestone时间点)

    Milestone 1
    Milestone 2
    ...

你的calendar里月历要有每个milestone的deadline。每天可以计划明天的任务，要符合milestone。要不惜一切代价完成当天的任务。
