##1. INTRODUCTION
Thialfi models shared data as versioned objects, which are stored at a data center and cached at clients. Clients `register` with Thialfi to be notified when an object changes, and the application’s servers notify Thialfi when updates occur. Thialfi propagates notifications to registered clients, which synchronize their data with application servers. Crucially, Thialfi delivers only the latest `version number` to clients, not application data, which simplifies our design and promotes scalability.

Thialfi’s implementation consists of a library embedded in client applications and two types of servers that run in Google data centers. `Matchers` are partitioned by object and receive and forward notifications; `Registrars` are partitioned by client and manage client registration and presence state. The client library communicates with the servers over a variety of application-specific channels; Thialfi protocols provide end-to-end reliability despite channel losses or message reordering. Finally, a best-effort replication protocol runs between Thialfi data centers, and clients correct out-of-date servers during migration.

A principal feature of Thialfi’s design is reliability in the presence of a wide variety of faults.

##2. MOTIVATION AND REQUIREMENTS
Throughout the paper, we refer to application data as `objects`: named, versioned entities for which users may receive notifications. For example, a contacts application might model each user’s address book as an object identified by that user’s email address, or the application may model each contact as a separate object. Contacts may be shared among users or a user’s devices. When the contact list is changed, its version number increases, providing a simple mechanism to represent changes.

A general notification service should satisfy at least four requirements:

* **Tracking**. The service should track which clients are interested in what data. Particularly for shared data, tracking a mapping between clients and objects is a common need.
* **Reliability**. Notifications should be reliable. To the extent possible, application developers should not be burdened with error detection and recovery mechanisms such as polling.
* **End-to-end**. Given an unreliable channel, the service must provide reliability in an end-to-end manner; i.e., it must include a client-side component.
* **Flexibility**. To be widely applicable, a notification service must impose few restrictions on developers. It should support web, desktop, and mobile applications written in a variety of languages for a variety of platforms. At the server, similar diversity in storage and communication dependencies precludes tight integration with a particular software stack. We show the variety of configurations that Thialfi supports in Table 1.

##3. OVERVIEW
####3.1 Model and Architecture

**Client library**: The client library provides applications with a programmatic interface for registering for shared objects and receiving notifications. The library speaks the Thialfi protocol and communicates with the Thialfi infrastructure service running in data centers. An application uses the Thialfi library to register for objects, and the library invokes callbacks to inform the application of registration changes and to deliver notifications. For each notification, Thialfi informs the application of the modified object’s identifier and the latest version known. When the application receives a notification, it synchronizes object data by talking directly with its servers: Thialfi does not provide data synchronization.

**Server infrastructure**: In the datacenter,application servers apply updates and notify Thialfi when objects change. We provide a `Publisher` library that application backends can embed. The publisher library call:

    Publish(objectId, version, source)

ensures that all Thialfi data centers are notified of the change. When present, the optional source parameter identifies the client that made the change. (This ID is provided by the application client at startup and is referred to as its application ID.) As an optimization, Thialfi omits delivery of the notification to this client, since the client already knows about the change.

####3.2 Security
Given the diversity of authorization and authentication techniques used by applications, Thialfi does not dictate a particular scheme for securing notifications. Instead, we provide hooks for applications to participate in securing their data at various points in the system.

####3.3 Client API and Usage

![3](/assets/2013-08-26-thialfi/3.png)

The `NotificationClient` interface lists the actions available via the client library. The `Start()` method initializes the client, and the `Register()` and `Unregister()` calls can be used to register/unregister for object notifications. We point out that the client interface does not include support for generating notifications. `Publish()` calls must be made by the application backend.

The `NotificationListener` interface defines callbacks invoked by the client library to notify the user application of status changes. Application programmers using Thialfi’s library implement these methods. When the library receives a notification from the server, it calls `Notify()` with that object’s ID and new version number. In scenarios where Thialfi does not know the version number of the object (e.g., if Thialfi has never received any update for the object or has deleted the last known version value for it), the client library uses the `NotifyUnknown()` call to inform the application that it should refetch the object from the application store regardless of its cached version. Internally, such notifications are assigned a sequence number by the server so that they can be reliably delivered and acknowledged in the protocol.

The client library invokes `RegistrationStatusChanged()` to inform the application of any registration information that it receives from the server. It uses `RegistrationFailure()` to indicate a registration operation failure to the application. A boolean, `isTransient`, indicates whether the application should attempt to retry the operation. `ReissueRegistrations()` allows the client library to request all registrations from the application. This call can be used to ensure that Thialfi state matches the application’s intent, e.g., after a loss of server state.

The `WriteState()` call is an optional method that provides Thialfi with persistent storage on the client, if available. Client data storage is application-specific; e.g., some applications have direct access to the filesystem while others are limited to a browser cookie. When a client receives its identifier from the server, the client library invokes WriteState() with an opaque byte string encoding the identifier, which is then stored by the application and provided to Thialfi during subsequent invocations of Start(). This allows clients to resume using existing registrations and notification state. Clients that do not support persistence are treated as new clients after each restart.

##4. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

![4](/assets/2013-08-26-thialfi/4.png)

Figure 3 shows the major components of Thialfi. `Bridge` servers are stateless, randomly load-balanced tasks that consume a feed of application-specific update messages from Google’s infrastructure pub/sub service, translate them into a standard notification format, and assemble them into batches for delivery to `Matcher` tasks. Matchers consume notifications for objects, match them with the set of registered clients, and forward them to the `Registrar` for reliable delivery to clients. Matchers are partitioned over the set of objects and maintain a view of state indexed by object ID. Registrars track clients, process registrations, and reliably deliver notifications using a view of state indexed by client ID.

####4.1 In-memory Design
An in-memory version of Thialfi stores client and object state in the memory of the Registrar and Matcher servers. As mentioned above, **clients are partitioned over Registrar servers, and objects are partitioned over Matcher servers.** In order to ensure roughly uniform distribution of load, each client and object is assigned a `partitioning key`.

#####4.1.1 In-memory State
**Registrar**: For each client, the Registrar servers maintain two sets: 1) registrations (objects of interest to the client) and 2) pending notifications (notifications not yet acknowledged by the client). They also maintain a monotonically-increasing sequence number for each client, used to pick an ordering for registration operations and to generate version numbers for unknown-version notifications.

**Matcher**: For each object, Matcher servers store the latest version number provided by the application backend. Matcher servers also maintain a copy of the registered clients for each object from the Registrar; this copy is updated asynchronously. We refer to the combined Matcher and Registrar state as the C/O-Cache (Client and Object cache).

Thialfi components that we call `Propagators` asynchronously propagate state between Matchers and Registrars. The Registrar Propagator copies client registrations to the Matcher, and the Matcher Propagator copies new notifications to the Registrar.

#####4.1.2 Client Token Management
Thialfi identifies clients using client tokens issued by Registrars. Tokens are composed of two parts: `client identifiers` and `session identifiers`. A client identifier is unique and persists for the lifetime of the client’s state. A session identifier binds a client to a particular Thialfi data center and contains the identity of the data center that issued the token.

A client acquires tokens via a handshake protocol, in which the Registrar creates an entry for the client’s state. If the client later migrates to another data center, the Registrar detects that the token was issued elsewhere and informs the client to repeat the handshake protocol with the current data center. When possible, the new token reuses the existing client identifier. A client may thus acquire many session identifiers during its interactions with Thialfi, although it holds only one client token (and thus one session identifier) at any given time.

The Thialfi client library sends periodic heartbeat messages to the Registrar to indicate that it is online (a Registrar only sends notifications to online clients). In the current implementation, the heartbeat interval is 20 minutes, and the Registrar considers a client to be offline if it has not received any message from the client for 80 minutes.

#####4.1.3 Registration Operation

![5](/assets/2013-08-26-thialfi/5.png)

1. The client library sends a registration message to the Registrar with the object identifier.
2. The Registrar picks an ordering for the registration by assigning it a sequence number, using the sequence number it maintains for the issuing client. The Registrar writes the registration to the client record and adds a new entry to the pending operation set.
3. Subsequently, the Registrar Propagator attempts to forward the registration and the application ID of the registering client to the Matcher responsible for the object via an RPC, and the Matcher updates the copy of the registration in its object cache. The Registrar Propagator repeats this until either propagation succeeds or its process crashes.
4. After propagation succeeds, the Registrar reads the latest version of the object from the Matcher (which reads the versions from its object cache) and writes a pending notification for it into the client cache (i.e., updates its copy of the latest version). We call this process Registrar post-propagation. If no version is known, the Registrar generates an unknown-version notification for the object with the version field set using the sequence number maintained for the client.
5. The Registrar sends a message to the client confirming the registration and removes the operation from the pending set.

Clients unregister using an analogous process. To keep the registrations at the client and the Registrar in sync, Thialfi uses a `Registration Sync Protocol`. Each message from the client contains a digest of the client’s registered objects, and each message from the server contains the digest of the client’s registrations known to the server (in our current implementation, we compute the digest using HMAC-SHA1).

The client library keeps track of the application’s intended registrations via registration/unregistration API calls. To preserve the registration state across application restarts, the library could write all registrations to the local disk using the WriteState() call (Section 3.3). To simplify persistence requirements, however, Thialfi relies on applications to restate intended registrations on restart.

When a client restarts, the client library invokes ReissueRegistrations(). The library then recomputes the digest and sends it as part of the regular communication with the server (e.g., in heartbeats). Any discrepancy in the registrations is detected and resolved using the Registration Sync Protocol discussed above. In the normal case when digests match, no registrations are resent to the server.

#####4.1.4 Notification Operation

![6](/assets/2013-08-26-thialfi/6.png)

1. The application server updates its authoritative copy of user data and notifies Thialfi of the new version number. Applications publish notifications using a library that ensures each published notification is received by all data centers running Thialfi. Currently, we use an internal Google infrastructure publish/subscribe service to disseminate messages to data centers. The pub/sub service acknowledges the Publisher library only after a reliable handoff, ensuring eventual delivery. (During periods of subscriber unavailability, the pub/sub service buffers notifications in a persistent log.)
2. Thialfi’s Bridge component consumes the feed of published notifications in each data center and processes them in small batches. The Bridge delivers the update to the Matcher server responsible for the object.
3. The Matcher updates its record for the object with the new version number. Subsequently, using its copy of the registered client list, the Matcher propagator determines which Registrar servers have clients registered for the object. It sends RPCs to each Registrar server with (client, oid, version) tuples indicating which clients need to be notified. The client identifiers are used to index the Registrar’s C/O-Cache efficiently.
4. Each Registrar receiving a message stores the pending notification for the appropriate clients and responds to the RPC.
5. When all Registrars have responded, the operation is removed from the Matcher pending operation set.
6. Periodically, the Registrars resend unacknowledged notifications for online clients. Currently, we use a 60-second retransmission interval.

#####4.1.5 Handling Server Failures
For simplicity, consider a brute-force approach: if any server fails,all servers restart, and the data center identifier is changed to a new value. Subsequent messages from clients with old tokens are detected by the Registrars, triggering a token update as described in §4.1.2. The Registration Sync Protocol then ensures that the clients reissue their registrations.

Client registration messages are sufficient to reconstruct the registration state at the Registrar. The latest-version data at the Matcher is not recovered (and pending notifications are lost) since there is no mechanism to fetch version information from the application backend. Nonetheless, correctness is not compromised. When processing client registrations, the Registrar will send unknownversion notifications for each registered object. This triggers client requests to the application backend to learn the latest version. Such an approach is conservative since the data may not have changed, but Thialfi cannot easily confirm this. After restart, Thialfi resumes normal processing of updates.

#####4.1.6 Handling Network Failures
There are three types of messages sent between the client and server: client token requests, registration changes, and notifications / acks. Any of these may be lost, reordered, or duplicated. Notifications are acknowledged and hence reliably delivered, and reordering and duplication are explicitly permitted by the semantics of Thialfi. All other messages are retried by the client as needed. Clients detect and ignore duplicate or reordered token grant messages from the Registrar using a nonce, and the Registration Sync Protocol ensures that client and server registration state eventually converge.

####4.2 Persistent Storage
#####4.2.1 Bigtable Layout

![7](/assets/2013-08-26-thialfi/7.png)

The Bigtable schema is summarized in Table 2. Each row of the Matcher table stores the latest known version for an object, the application ID of the client that created that version, and the set of clients registered for that object. Each Registrar row stores the client’s application ID, the latest sequence number that was generated for the client by the Registrar, a channel-specific address if the client is online, the object IDs that the client is registered for, and the objects for which the client has an unacknowledged notifica- tion. Each table also contains a column for tracking which rows have pending information to propagate to the other table. Note that a cell is written in the last-seqno column whenever a sequence number is used for the client. This ensures that sequence numbers always increase.

#####4.2.2 In-memory State
In order to improve performance, we cache a small amount of state from Bigtable in Registrar and Matcher server memory. The Registrars cache the registration digest of each online client (but not the full set of registrations). The Matchers and Registrars also cache their pending operation sets.

#####4.2.3 Pushing Notifications to Clients
As with the in-memory design, reliable notification delivery to clients is achieved by scanning for unacknowledged notifications. Instead of memory, the scan is over the Registrar Bigtable. For efficiency and performance, we also introduce a `fast path`: we unreliably send notifications to online clients during Matcher propagation. While channels are unreliable, message drops are rare, so this fast path typically succeeds. 

#####4.2.4 Client Garbage Collection
If a client remains offline for an extended period (e.g., several days), Thialfi garbage-collects its Bigtable state. This involves deleting the client’s row in the Registrar Bigtable and deleting any registration cells in the Matcher Bigtable. If the client later comes back online, our use of blind writes means that the client’s row may be inadvertently recreated.

In order to detect client resurrection after garbage collection, Thialfi maintains a created cell in the client’s Registrar row (Table 2). The Registrar writes this cell when it assigns an ID for a client, and the garbage collector deletes it; no other operations modify this cell. If a garbage collected client comes back online as described above, its created cell will be absent from the recreated row. An asynchronous process periodically scans the Registrar Table for rows without created cells. When encountered, the ‘zombie’ client row is deleted. Also, if the client is online, it is informed that its ID is invalid. Upon receiving this message, the client discards its ID and reconnects as a new client. This message may be lost without compromising correctness; it will be resent by the asynchronous process if the client attempts further operations.

#####4.2.5 Recovery from Server Failures
We now describe how persistent storage reduces the burden of failure recovery. The server caches of Bigtable state and of pending operations are write-through caches, so they may be restored after a restart by simply scanning the Bigtable. Since each server is assigned a contiguous range, this scan is efficient. Additionally, scanning to recover pending operations yields a straightforward strategy for shedding load during periods of memory pressure: a server aborts in-progress propagations, evicts items from its pending operation set, and schedules a future scan to recover.

If required, all Bigtable state can be dropped, with recovery proceeding as in the in-memory design. In practice, this has simplified service administration significantly; e.g., when performing a Bigtable schema change, we simply drop all data, avoiding the complexity of migration.

#####4.2.6 Tolerating Storage Unavailability
A consequence of storing state in Bigtable is that Thialfi’s overall availability is limited by that of Bigtable. While complete unavailability is extremely rare, a practical reality of large-scale storage is `partial unavailability`—the temporary failure of I/O operations for some rows, but not all. 

Given the prevalence of such partial storage unavailability in practice, we have implemented a simple mechanism to prevent a backlog from being generated. To acknowledge a notification, the Bridge needs to record the latest version number `somewhere` in stable storage. It need not be written to the correct location immediately, so long as it is eventually propagated there. To provide robustness during these periods, we reissue failed writes to a distinct, scratch Bigtable. A scanner later retries the writes against the Matcher Bigtable. 

####4.3 Supporting Multiple Data Centers
#####4.3.1 State Replication
Thialfi uses two forms of state replication: 1) reliable replication of notifications to all data centers and 2) best-effort replication of registration state. The pub/sub service acknowledges the Publisher library after a reliable handoff and ensures that each notification is reliably delivered to all Thialfi data centers; the Thialfi Matchers in each data center acknowledge the notification only after it has been written to stable storage.

When replicating registration state, we use a custom, asynchronous protocol that replicates only the state we must reconstruct during migration. Specifically, we replicate three Registrar operations between Thialfi data centers: 1) client ID assignment, 2) registrations, and 3) notification acknowledgements. Whenever a Registrar pro- cesses one of these operations, it sends best-effort RPC messages to the Registrars in other data centers. At each data center, replication agents in the Registrar consume these messages and replay the operations. (While we have implemented and evaluated this scheme, we have not yet deployed it in production.)

We initially attempted to avoid designing our own replication scheme. A previous design of Thialfi used a synchronous, globally consistent storage layer called Megastore. Megastore provides transactional storage with consistency guarantees spanning data centers. Building on such a system is appealingly straightforward: simply commit a transaction that updates relevant rows in all data centers before acknowledging an operation. Unfortunately, microbenchmarks show that Megastore requires roughly 10 times more operations per write to its underlying Bigtables than a customized approach. For a write-intensive service like Thialfi, this overhead is prohibitive.

Although the Thialfi replication protocol is designed to make migration efficient, an outage still causes a spike in load. During a planned outage, we use an anti-storm technique to spread load. During a migration storm, Thialfi silently drops messages from a progressively-decreasing fraction of migrated clients at the surviving data centers, trading short-term unavailability for reduced load.

##5. ACHIEVING RELIABLE DELIVERY
￼We define reliable delivery as follows:
    
    If a well-behaved client registers for an object X, 
    Thialfi ensures that the client will always eventually learn of the latest version of X.

**Registration state** is determined by the client, from which it propagates to the Registrar and Matcher (subject to access control policies). The following mechanisms ensure the eventual synchronization of registration state across the three components:

* **Client ↔ Registrar**: Every message from the client includes a digest that summarizes all client registration state (§4.1.3). If the client-provided digest disagrees with the state at the Registrar, the synchronization protocol runs, after which client and server agree. Periodic heartbeat messages include the registration digest, ensuring that any disagreement will be detected.
* **Registrar → Matcher**: When the Registrar commits a registration state change to Bigtable, a pending work marker is also set atomically. This marker is cleared only after all dependent writes to the Matcher Bigtable have completed successfully. All writes are retried by the Registrar Propagator if any failure occurs. (Because all writes are idempotent, this repetition is safe.)

**Notification state** comes from the Publisher, which provides a reliable feed of object-version pairs via the pub/sub service. These flow reliably through the Bridge, Matcher, and Registrar to the client using the following mechanisms:

* **Bridge → Matcher**: Notifications are removed from the update feed by the Bridge only after they have been successfully written to either their appropriate location in the Matcher Bigtable or buffered in the Matcher scratch Bigtable. A periodic task in the Bridge reads the scratch table and resends the notifications to the Matcher, removing entries from the scratch table only after a successful Matcher write.
* **Matcher → Registrar**: When a notification is written to the Matcher Bigtable, a pending work marker is used to ensure eventual propagation. This mechanism is similar to that used for Registrar → Matcher propagation of registration state.

Notification state also flows from the Matcher to the Registrar in response to registration state changes. After a client registers for an object, Registrar post-propagation will write a notification at the latest version into the client’s Registrar row (§4.1.3). This ensures that the client learns of the latest version even if the notification originally arrived before the client’s registration.

* **Registrar → Client**: The Registrar retains a notification for a client until either the client acknowledges it or a subsequent notification supersedes it. The Registrar periodically retransmits any outstanding notifications while the client is online, ensuring eventual delivery.

Taken together, local state propagation among components provides end-to-end reliability. Specifically:

* A client’s registration eventually propagates to the Matcher, ensuring that the latest notification received for the registered object after the propagation will be sent to the client.
* Registrar post-propagation ensures that a client learns the version of the object known to Thialfi when its registration reached the Matcher. If no version was present at the Matcher, the client receives a notification at `unknown version`.
