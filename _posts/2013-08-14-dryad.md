##1. INTRODUCTION
We summarize Dryad’s contributions as follows:

* We built a general-purpose, high performance distributed execution engine. The Dryad execution engine handles many of the difficult problems of creating a large distributed, concurrent application: scheduling across resources, optimizing the level of concurrency within a computer, recovering from communication or computer failures, and delivering data to where it is needed. Dryad supports multiple different data transport mechanisms between computation vertices and explicit dataflow graph construction and refinement.
* We demonstrated the excellent performance of Dryad from a single multi-core computer up to clusters consisting of thousands of computers on several nontrivial, real examples. We further demonstrated that Dryad’s fine control over an application’s dataflow graph gives the programmer the necessary tools to optimize tradeoffs between parallelism and data distribution overhead. This validated Dryad’s design choices.
* We explored the programmability of Dryad on two fronts. First, we have designed a simple graph description language that empowers the developer with explicit graph construction and refinement to fully take advantage of the rich features of the Dryad execution engine. Our user experiences lead us to believe that, while it requires some effort to learn, a programmer can master the APIs required for most of the applications in a couple of weeks. Second, we (and others within Microsoft) have built simpler, higher-level programming abstractions for specific application domains on top of Dryad. This has significantly lowered the barrier to entry and increased the acceptance of Dryad among domain experts who are interested in using Dryad for rapid application prototyping. This further validated Dryad’s design choices.
